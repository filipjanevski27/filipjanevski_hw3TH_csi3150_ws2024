      <h2>Bears, Trains & Icebergs with Rail from Anchorage</h2>
      <div class="right">
        <p>
          Your Bears, Trains and Icebergs adventures starts with a scenic ride
          on the Alaska Railroad's Glacier Discovery train. The train departs
          from the Anchorage Depot located at 411 West First Avenue at 9:45am.
          After traveling through Anchorage you will descend through the
          Acnhorage Coastal Wildlife Refuge.
        </p>
        <h5>What To Wear</h5>
        <p>
          Your trip includes professional guides, raingear, rubber boots and a
          small snack. Dress warmly in layers as conditions around the icebergs
          can be chilly. Please bring thick socks (to wear with provided rubber
          boots), warm clothes (wear synthetic layers and bring a rain coat),
          warm hat and gloves. You may wish to bring binoculars and a camera if
          you have them.

        "This was a fantastic experience, we saw so much, the wildlife, the
        scenery and met interesting people and realy got to know Alaska! It
        really was the best way to see Alaska! We loved getting out onto the
        glacier with crampons. My daughter loved the ice climbing. Sea kayaking
        was great. Thank you for a memorable, unique trip!"
